# 3DMigoto Mod Pack Merger — Dev Branch

⚠️ This is the **development branch** of the 3DMigoto Mod Pack Merger.  
It may contain experimental features, debugging tools, and unfinished logic.

If you are a normal user, use the [**main / release version**](https://github.com/UnLuckyLust/3DMigoto-Pack-Merger/tree/main) instead.

## What is This Tool?

3DMigoto Mod Pack Merger allows you to:

• Merge multiple mod folders into one cycle pack  
• Auto-patch mod INIs (namespace + gated overrides)  
• Add missing mods to an existing pack  
• Restore all mods  
• Restore a single mod  
• Toggle Vanilla (no mod) as a cycle option  
• Multi-language support  
• Clean auto-generated pack INI structure  

## Dev Branch Purpose

This branch exists for:

• Testing new features before release  
• Version checking logic  
• Internal improvements and refactors  
• Performance optimizations  
• Experimental behavior changes  
• Debug logging  
• Structural rewrites  

Things here may:

• Change without notice  
• Break existing packs  
• Require manual cleanup  
• Contain incomplete features  

## Reporting Issues

If something breaks:

• Provide the pack folder structure  
• Include the generated INI  
• Include the mod INI that fails  
• Include error logs from `%TEMP%`  
• Tell which branch and version you’re using
